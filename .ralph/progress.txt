## 2026-01-15 - ralph-cli-b75
- Removed custom ralph-plan skill - beads now handles AI-managed task tracking
- Files changed:
  - Deleted `.claude/skills/ralph-plan/SKILL.md`
  - `source/components/SetupWizard.tsx` - Removed skill installation step
  - `source/utils/setup-scaffolding.ts` - Removed `installRalphPlanSkill` function and references
  - `source/utils/setup-checker.ts` - Removed skill path from `getRalphPaths` and check items
  - `source/templates/index.ts` - Removed `DEFAULT_RALPH_PLAN_SKILL` constant
  - `source/types/config.ts` - Removed `skillsDir` and `ralphPlanSkill` from `RalphPaths`
  - `source/app.tsx` - Updated "no-prd" view message to reference beads
  - `readme.md` - Updated documentation to reflect beads workflow
  - `.prettierignore` - Added `.beads`, `.claude`, `CLAUDE.md` to ignore formatting
- **Learnings:**
  - The ralph-plan skill was used for PRD-based planning (prd.json) - now replaced by beads
  - Multiple files referenced the skill: types, scaffolding, checker, templates, UI components
  - Pre-existing test infrastructure issues (eslint unicorn plugin, ava config) not related to changes

## 2026-01-15 - ralph-cli-w9o
- Fixed output stream visualization issue where tool calls broke TUI layout
- Root cause: Multi-line content in tool use/result strings (e.g., code snippets with newlines) was displayed without normalization
- Files changed:
  - `source/lib/stream-formatter.ts` - Added `normalizeWhitespace()` function and updated `truncate()` to normalize whitespace before display
- **Learnings:**
  - The `truncate()` function is used throughout the stream formatter for both tool inputs and outputs
  - TUI components like OutputPanel expect single-line strings per logical entry; embedded newlines break layout
  - The fix normalizes `\n`, `\r`, `\t` to spaces and collapses multiple consecutive spaces
  - Pre-existing test infrastructure issues prevent running ava tests, but manual testing via node confirms fix works
